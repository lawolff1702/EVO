    "## Exploring Diversity Metrics: The Diversity Metrics We Chose in this Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "### *In this section of our project, we implemented four different diversity metrics to help guide the evolutionary optimization process for our Deep Neural Network (DNN). We used diversity as a penalty/bonus in our loss function to encourage the weight vector population to stay varied, preventing premature convergance on a non-optimal weight vector solution, and promoting wide exploration of possible solutions. Below is an explanation of each metric and how it is implemented:*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Euclidean Distance: Euclidean distance tells use the average \"straight-line\" distance between pairs of individuals in the population. In our case, this is done by computing the total distance - the square root of the sum of constituent pairwise distances - between each pair of vectors in the population. In our code, we do this by normalizing the difference between pairs of weight vectors in our population (`python torch.norm(weight_vector_i - weight_vector_j)) and then averaging that value for all weight vectors in the population. Higher output values for this metric represent that individuals are spread out in space - that they have diverse weights between them - and thus that they have a higher diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Cosine Dissimilarity: Cosine Dissimilarity tells us about the difference between weight vectors based on the angles of those vectors in space (not including magnitude). I implemented this by normalizing our vectors, to eliminate the effect of their magnitudes, and creating a matrix with all of our weight vectors. I then perform matrix multiplication between this matrix and its transpose, resulting in a matrix where each entry is the cosine similarity between two vectors (as the dot product of two normalized vectors is their cosine similarity). Then, we subtract this value from 1 for every entry in the matrix, and return the mean of this to get the average cosine dissimilarity for all vectors in our population. A high value here means that individual weight vectors point in different directions/have different angles in feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Standard Deviation: Standard deviation measures how spread out our weights are in each dimension, and then averaging this value out across all dimensions. In other words, it tells us how much variation there is across the population for each individual weight. If all weight vectors vary significantly in the same weight component, then the standard deviation will be large. It is a simple and computationally cheap approximation of diversity, and is implemented with the torch.std() function that calculates standard deviation across a tensor. A high standard deviation means we have more dispersed weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Variance: Variance is similar to standard deviation in that is measures the spread of weights in our feature dimensions, but keeps the square value of the spread to emphasize larger differences. To clarify, variance is the square of standard deviation. Thus, while it similarly measures variation across each weight, it puts more emphasis on outliers. As such, variance can be more helpful in penalizing tight clustering than standard deviation. This is implemented by using torch.var() across a weight vector population, and then averaging this across all dimensions to calculate average variance. Again, high variance means high diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our EvolutionOptimizer class, the diversity metric can dynamically be set using the set_diversity_metric() function. When we then compute diversity, the model automatically adjusts the loss function by abstractly calculating the diversity term (diversity_term = self.optimizer.compute_diversity()). In our model's loss function, we include this diversity term to introduce a diversity penalty - i.e. a less diverse population will result in higher loss - alongside traditional classification loss. Here is the key line of code which can be found in the source code:\n",
    "\n",
    "`return loss - (self.diversity_coeff * diversity_term)`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, `loss` is the actual loss which is calculated using the traditional Cross Entropy loss function from torch.nn. The `self.diversity_coeff` is a scalar indicates how strongly we reward high diversity - or really how much we punish low diversity. The `diversity_term` measures how spread our population is. This, when diversity is low, the diversity term is small and loss will be higher. If diversity is high, then more will be subtracted from loss, rewarding us with lower total loss. These will both be amplified by a higher diversity_coeff value. All of this encourages the optimizer to keep the populating diverse, promoting deeper exploration. Ultimately, this can be understood as a form of regularization which penalizes a lack of diversity rather than large weights."
