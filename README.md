# EVO: Project Proposal
#### **Group Members:** Yahya Rahhawi, James Cummings, Jiffy Lesica, Lukka Wolff

### Abstract
Using principles of evolution to build a machine learning algorithm and explore its capabilities compared to gradient descent - we will focus primarily on its ability to solve non-differentiable problems. Explore different changes to the evolutionary principles and compare the performance with those changes: adjust mutation rates, mutation magnitude, fitness criteria, and population management. Through various explorations such as symbolic regression, handwriting recognition, and evolving feature selection, we will demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of applying evolutionary principles to machine learning. 

### Motivation and Question

### Planned Deliverables

- Implementation of Evolution based machine learning algorithm
- Application of algorithm to Symbolic Regression problem
- Application of algorithm to MNIST handwriting recognition problem
- Evolving feature selection on classification (Breast Cancer dataset)
- Comparison of different implementations of evolution: evolution based feature selection, diversity preservation principles, island models, etc
