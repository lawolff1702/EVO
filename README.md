# EVO: Project Proposal
#### **Group Members:** Yahya Rahhawi, James Cummings, Jiffy Lesica, Lukka Wolff

### Abstract
| Using principles of evolution to build a machine learning algorithm and explore its capabilities compared to gradient descent - we will focus primarily on its ability to solve non-differentiable problems. Explore different changes to the evolutionary principles and compare the performance with those changes: adjust mutation rates, mutation magnitude, fitness criteria, and population management. Through these explorations we will demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of applying evolutionary principles to machine learning.

### Motivation and Question

### Resources Required

### What You Will Learn

### Risk Statement

### Ethics Statement

As part of our machine learning project exploring evolutionary optimization techniques,
we recognize the importance of addressing ethical considerations that relate to the
potential impacts of our work. Below are reflections based on the core questions on the assignment:

---

### Who could benefit from our project?

Our project combines bio-inspired evolutionary algorithms with core ML tasks such as
classification, symbolic regression, and feature selection. The following groups stand
to benefit:

- **Machine learning researchers** seeking novel, interpretable
  optimization techniques beyond gradient descent.
- **Students and educators**, as our implementation can serve as an engaging and
  educational example of evolutionary computation applied to ML.
- **Medical and health research communities**, particularly if we apply evolutionary
  feature selection to datasets like the breast cancer dataset, potentially leading to
  more accurate and concise diagnostic models.

---

### Who could be excluded or harmed?

We are aware of risks and limitations associated with our approach:

- **Bias in datasets**: Using datasets such as breast cancer data may result in biased
  models if the data lacks demographic diversity, leading to exclusion or harm to
  underrepresented groups.
- **Overtrust in evolved models**: Symbolic regression models or evolved classifiers may
  be interpreted as more accurate or fair than they truly are, particularly if their
  simplicity is mistaken for correctness.
- **Accessibility concerns**: Users without a CS or ML background may be excluded from
  benefiting if we do not provide explanations, visualizations, or clear documentation.
