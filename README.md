# EVO: Project Proposal
#### **Group Members:** Yahya Rahhawi, James Cummings, Jiffy Lesica, Lukka Wolff

### Abstract
| Using principles of evolution to build a machine learning algorithm and explore its capabilities compared to gradient descent - we will focus primarily on its ability to solve non-differentiable problems. Explore different changes to the evolutionary principles and compare the performance with those changes: adjust mutation rates, mutation magnitude, fitness criteria, and population management. Through these explorations we will demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of applying evolutionary principles to machine learning.
