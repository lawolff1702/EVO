# EVO: Project Proposal
#### **Group Members:** Yahya Rahhawi, James Cummings, Jiffy Lesica, Lukka Wolff

### Abstract
Using principles of evolution to build a machine learning algorithm and explore its capabilities compared to gradient descent - we will focus primarily on its ability to solve non-differentiable problems. Explore different changes to the evolutionary principles and compare the performance with those changes: adjust mutation rates, mutation magnitude, fitness criteria, and population management. Through various explorations such as symbolic regression, handwriting recognition, and evolving feature selection, we will demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of applying evolutionary principles to machine learning. 

### Motivation and Question

### Planned Deliverables

- Implementation of Evolution based machine learning algorithm
- Application of algorithm to Symbolic Regression problem
- Application of algorithm to MNIST handwriting recognition problem
- Evolving feature selection on classification (Breast Cancer dataset)
- Comparison of different implementations of evolution: evolution based feature selection, diversity preservation principles, island models, etc

### Resources Required

### What You Will Learn

In this project, group members will deepen their understanding of evolutionary machine learning algorithms, focusing on how evolutionary principles compare to or complement gradient descent methods in non-differentiable problem contexts. As such, part of this project will involve familiarization with the complexities and real-life examples of non-differentiable problems. We will gain hands-on experience implementing evolution-inspired ML techniques, including adjusting mutation rates and weights, and defining selection criteria tailored for given sub-problems (such as symbolic regression or MNIST handwriting recognition).

Group members will also enhance their proficiency in Python programming using machine learning libraries such as PyTorch. The team will strengthen project management skills involving task designation and completion tracking on Github. Further, we will refine our understanding of collaborative workflows by developing our project on local git branches. Finally, participants will critically assess algorithmic performance - i.e. results of data analysis for non-differentiable problems using gradient descent vs. evolutionary algorithms - and effectively communicate the strengths, limitations, and appropriate applications of evolutionary machine learning techniques.
